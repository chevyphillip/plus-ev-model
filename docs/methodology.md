# NBA Stats Pipeline and Model Methodology

## Data Pipeline Architecture

### 1. Data Collection

- Source: NBA official API
- Frequency: Daily updates
- Scope: Last 4 seasons (2021-22 through 2024-25)
- Statistics: Per-game averages and totals

### 2. Database Architecture

#### Local DuckDB

- Primary storage for raw and processed data
- Schema optimized for analytical queries
- Indices on frequently accessed columns
- Support for complex SQL operations

#### MotherDuck Cloud Integration

- Real-time sync with local database
- Cloud-based access for collaboration
- Automatic backup and versioning
- Distributed query execution

### 3. Data Processing Steps

1. Raw Data Ingestion
   - NBA API connection with rate limiting
   - JSON response parsing
   - Data validation and cleaning

2. Feature Engineering
   - Rolling averages (5-game window)
   - Season-to-date statistics
   - Performance trend indicators

3. Data Transformation
   - Type conversion and standardization
   - Missing value handling
   - Outlier detection

## Model Architecture

### 1. Assist Prediction Model

#### Features

- 5-game rolling averages:
  - Assists (strongest predictor)
  - Points
  - Minutes played
  - Field goal percentage
  - Plus/minus

#### Model Selection

- Algorithm: Logistic Regression
- Target: Binary classification (5+ assists)
- Scaling: StandardScaler for feature normalization
- Random state: 42 for reproducibility

### 2. Model Performance

#### Metrics

- Accuracy: 92.2%
- Precision: 80.0%
- Recall: 61.5%
- F1 Score: 69.6%
- ROC AUC: 97.6%

#### Feature Importance

1. ast_rolling_5: 2.23
2. pts_rolling_5: 0.65
3. min_rolling_5: 0.64
4. fg_pct_rolling_5: 0.27
5. plus_minus_rolling_5: 0.01

### 3. Validation Results

Example predictions for top playmakers:

```
Player                  Prob    Avg
Trae Young             99.9%   10.6
Tyrese Haliburton      99.3%    9.5
James Harden           99.1%    9.4
Nikola JokiÄ‡           99.7%    9.2
Chris Paul             97.0%    8.7
```
