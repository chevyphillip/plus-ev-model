# Proposed Model Improvements

## 1. Model Architecture Enhancements

### Extend Ensemble Approach

- Current ensemble model only handles high scorers (>17.8 pts)
- Implement specialized ensembles for each prop type
- Add XGBoost to model mix (currently using RF, GB, Lasso)
- Implement stacking with meta-learner

### Probability Distribution Improvements

- Replace normal distribution with skewed distributions for asymmetric props
- Implement Beta distribution for bounded props (e.g., shooting percentages)
- Add mixture models for multi-modal distributions

## 2. Feature Engineering

### Player Context

- Add player matchup history vs specific teams/defenders
- Incorporate player rest days and back-to-back game impact
- Add player career trajectory features

### Team Context

- Add team pace and style metrics
- Incorporate lineup-based features
- Add home/away streak impact

### Advanced Stats

- Add player usage rate when specific teammates are out
- Incorporate plus/minus by lineup combination
- Add shot quality metrics

## 3. Performance Issues to Address

### Points Model (R² = 0.648)

- Error width increases significantly for high scorers (11.383 interval)
- Implement specialized models for different scoring ranges
- Add defender matchup features

### Rebounds Model (R² = 0.620)

- Add team rebounding rate features
- Incorporate opponent lineup size metrics
- Add player position matchup features

### Assists Model (R² = 0.636)

- Add teammate shooting percentage features
- Incorporate ball handler rotation patterns
- Add team assist rate features

### Threes Model (R² = 0.333)

- Weakest performing model
- Add shot quality and defender distance metrics
- Incorporate team 3-point attempt rate
- Add catch-and-shoot vs pull-up features

## 4. Edge Finding Improvements

### Correlation Analysis

- Implement prop correlation matrix
- Add correlated prop edge adjustment
- Track historical correlation patterns

### Probability Calibration

- Implement Platt scaling for better probability estimates
- Add historical odds movement analysis
- Track closing line value

### Bet Sizing

- Implement portfolio optimization for correlated bets
- Add dynamic Kelly criterion based on model confidence
- Incorporate historical variance in bet sizing

## 5. System Improvements

### Automation

- Add automated odds monitoring
- Implement real-time bet alerts
- Add automated performance tracking

### GUI Enhancements

- Add historical performance visualization
- Implement bankroll management features
- Add correlation analysis view

### Validation

- Add out-of-sample validation periods
- Implement cross-validation by season
- Add player-specific validation metrics
